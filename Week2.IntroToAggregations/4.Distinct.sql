--DISTINCT

--DISTINCT is always used in SELECT statements, and it provides the unique rows for
--all columns written in the SELECT statement.
--Therefore, you only use DISTINCT once in any particular SELECT statement.

--You could write:

SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, column3
FROM table1;

--which would return the unique (or DISTINCT) rows across all three columns.

--You would not write:

SELECT DISTINCT column1, DISTINCT column2, DISTINCT column3
FROM table1;

--You can think of DISTINCT the same way you might think of the statement "unique".

SELECT DISTINCT a.id as account id,

                r.id as region id,
                r.name as region
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id;

--and


SELECT DISTINCT id, name
FROM accounts;

--2.
--Have any sales reps worked on more than one account?
SELECT s.id sales_rep_id,
       s.name sales_rep_name,
       COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.name
ORDER BY num_accounts;

--and

SELECT DISTINCT id, name
