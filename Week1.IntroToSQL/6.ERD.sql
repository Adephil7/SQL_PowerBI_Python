--Entity Relationship Diagrams

--entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a common way to view data in a database.

--a key element to understanding how we can pull data from multiple tables.

--KEYS

--PRIMARY key
--The PK here stands for primary key. A primary key exists in every table,
--and it is a column that has a unique value for every row.
-- It is common that the primary key is the first column in our tables in most databases.

--Foreign Key (FK)
--A foreign key is a column in one table that is a primary key in a different table.

--One-to-Many Relationship
--The crow's foot shows that the FK can actually appear in many rows in the sales_reps table.
--While the single line is telling us that the PK shows that id appears only once per row in this table.
