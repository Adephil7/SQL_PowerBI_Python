/*
If you would like to get more practice writing SQL queries, there are several great websites to practice
writing SQL queries. Here are a couple we recommend: HackerRank and ModeAnalytics. We strongly recommend
these. The skill test by AnalyticsVidhya is a fun test to take too.


You will need to create a profile for HackerRank and create an account for Mode Analytics, but these are
excellent routes to gain more practice and learn more advanced skills along the way. If you come across
exercises that require knowledge on concepts you haven't learned yet, feel free to google them. Spending
time practicing, making mistakes and learning from it - that is the best way to become a master at anything!
